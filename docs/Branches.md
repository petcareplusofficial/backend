# Branching Strategy

- ![Main](#main)
  - ![pre/beta](#pre-beta)
    - ![individual](#individual)

### main
This is deployable fully functional and tested code

### pre-beta
This is the branch after it has been tested and checked up by a pull request by another developer. After it has been successfully reviewed it will be merged here. Every Week this branch will be merged into the main branch.
### individual
This is the branch will be created one by individual. Here we will work on our features and develop our code. It will only send pull requests to pre/beta. No direct merge allowed!!!.

## Pull Requests

Always create a pull request when you are finished with your feature.
`Always` include `Erald` or `Neel` for review for either backend `Erald` and frontend `Neel`. You will merge after the reviewer approves the pull request.

## Testing

Always, Always, Always test your code before creating a pull request. It must be tested a few times and edge cases must be covered for smooth deployment and development.
